        <h1>Hacks | Hack@Teal</h1>

        <h2>Better BearWeb</h2>

        <p><strong>Hack@Teal 2015 Winner</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Team:</strong> Santiago Andaluz Ruiz, Jackson Swenson</p>

        <p>Our project idea was to grab all the information from bearweb
        regarding the class schedules and provide a better tool to use when
        scheduling classes. You would be able to select the term and different
        departments you wanted to see while being able to add specific classes
        to a list where it would total your hours and mention any scheduling
        conflicts</p>

        <h2>Get bing</h2>

        <p><strong>Hack@Teal 2015 Runner-Up</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Team:</strong> Cameron Wagstaff</p>

        <p>I took a bit of time to make a script that downloads the current
        bing background and sets it as my computer's desktop background.</p>

        <h2>BU Eats</h2>

        <p><strong>Hack@Teal 2015 People's Choice</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Team:</strong> Tanner Bennett, Megan Todd, Rachel Langdon, Justin Paul</p>

        <p> We made an app for iOS that displays the menu of each dining hall on
        campus any day up to 30 days ahead, whether or not each hall is open,
        and when they open or close. Probably gonna call it BU Dining or BU
        Eats.</p>

        <h2>Go Fish</h2>
        <p><strong>Team:</strong>Dyllan Macias, Chris Ginger</p>

        <p> Our Hack is designed for people who love to train their memory. In
        order to win, it is essential to recall what your opponents ask of you
        and your fellow players, or just be straight lucky. Our hack helps
        improve memory and social cognitive response, while maintaining a fun
        environment that is suitable for all ages. One of our flagship features
        is the ability to use Networking to connect to your friends over the
        internet, we are especially proud of this achievement. Although it is
        fun to do in a group, ECSGoFish can also be played against computer
        AI's, and trust me, they have a good memory. We hope you enjoy.</p>

        <h2>Shopping App</h2>
        <p><strong>Team:</strong> Alexander Tsatsoulas, Mallory Hightower</p>

        <p>We made an app for the android  to aid male and female shoppers! When
        shopping, a person may find something they like, but can they think back
        to every item in their closet to make sure they already have something
        that will go with/match the possible purchase?</p>

        <p>That is what the app is for. There is a homepage with different
        buttons such as shirt, purse, accessories, dresses, pants, and shoes.
        Clicking on each item will take you to the portfolio of your photos that
        you have uploaded to each category of clothing (these are photos of your
        own closet). Also, there will be data on the percentage of colors of
        your clothes, or when the last time you bought something. So far we have
        learned how to program on the android platform and to code (never have
        used any of this before) and are happy with the results!</p>

        <h2>Grabbear</h2>
        <p><strong>Team:</strong> Cameron Wagstaff, Brian Langford</p>

        <p>We made a utility to fetch classes offered by Baylor, and it's cool
        because who doesn't love raw data.</p>

        <h2>Stories in Two</h2>
        <p><strong>Team:</strong> Collin Rapp, Austin Sparkman</p>

        <p> Our program is a website that has built in stories in different
        languages that enables the user to click on the link and view the story
        in both an english and foreign language version side by side.  We call
        it Stories in Two and it's pretty neat. It features stories in Latin,
        Pidjin, and Spanish.</p>

        <h2>Emoji Suggester</h2>
        <p><strong>Team:</strong> Samuel Taylor, Matt Tinsley</p>

        <p> Have you ever used a smartphone keyboard that suggested words as you
        typed? Our project is that, but for emoji.</p>

        <p>We use the vector space model to suggest the best possible emojis for
        your message.</p>
